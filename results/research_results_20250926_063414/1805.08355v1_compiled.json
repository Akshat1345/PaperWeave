    "Introduction": "Deep learning is the main representative of the breakthrough in artiﬁcial intelligence today, it has reached nearly human level in image classiﬁcation , speech recognition , natural language processing and so on. The method of deep learning is developing rapidly, which almost subverts all branches of computer vision ﬁeld. However, the fundamental problem of deep learning at present is the lack of theoretical research on its internal principles, and there is no accepted theoretical explanation, namely, the so-called black box problem: Why use such a deep model in deep learning? Why is deep learning successful? What’s the key inside? The lack of theoretical basis has led to the academic community being unable to explain the fundamental reason for the success of deep learning. The theoretical basis is not clear, and we simply do not know from what angle to look at it. The black box model is purely based on data without considering the physical laws of the model, it lacks the ability to adhere to mechanistic understandings of the underlying physical processes. Hence, even if the model achieves high accuracy but it lacks of theoretical support, it cannot be used as a basis for subsequent scientiﬁc developments . We must not rely solely on intuition designed algorithmic structures and several empirically tried examples to prove the general validity of an algorithm. This research method has the potential to learn false modes from non-generic representations of data, the explanatory nature of the model is very low, and the resulting research results are difﬁcult to pass on in the long term. As people’s new ideas have been replaced by more and more complex model architectures, which are almost invisible under the weight of layers of models, calls for attention to the explanatory nature of machine learning are also getting higher. Therefore, we need to thoroughly understand the entire system operation of deep learning. We need to explain what the most fundamental problems are in the ﬁeld of deep learning and whether arXiv:1805.08355v1 [cs.LG] May these fundamental issues are mature enough to be accurately described in mathematical and physical languages. The great success of deep learning shows that its technology contains profound truth, but the most widely understood way is mathematical analysis, so far, very little attention has been paid to its scientiﬁc issues. However, purely mathematical explanations may lead to misdirection. For example, the neural network is mathematically trying to approximate any function. In mathematics, it has been proved that a single-layer neural network can approximate any function if it is long enough, this viewpoint has greatly hindered the development of neural networks, this is why most people in the past neglected multi-layer networks for a long time and without studying in depth. Only a small number of people such as Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio still insist on research in multi-layer neural networks . Therefore, from the great successes achieved in deep learning, it is far from enough to explain deep learning in mathematics, and the technology of deep learning needs to be based on scientiﬁc theory. As deep learning has made breakthroughs in many aspects such as images, phonetics, and text, methods based on deep learning are increasingly being applied in various other ﬁelds, for example, recently effective in solving many-body quantum physics problems has also been proved. Therefore, the theory of deep learning methods must reﬂect some objective laws of the real world. obviously the most basic and universal theory is quantum physics and statistical physics. What is science? Physics is the most perfect science that has been developed so far. Just as most engineering disciplines are based on physics, the engineering foundation for deep learning now and in the future will be physics. We need to describe the deep learning concept model in the language of physics, so that we can scientiﬁcally guide the development and design of deep learning. From this we say that the key to the current and future success of artiﬁcial intelligence depends not only on the mathematical calculation, but also on the laws of physics. The theory of deep learning requires physics. The data in the information world is divided into two different types of data: one is symbolic data, which is designated by our humans; the other is physical data, which objectively reﬂects the data of the real world, any actual data set we care about (whether it is a natural image or a voice signal, etc.) is physical data. Reference shows that the reason why neural networks can perform classiﬁcation tasks well is that these physical data x follow some simple physical laws and models can be generated with relatively few free parameters: for example, they may exhibit symmetry, locality, or a simple form as an exponent of a low-order polynomial; and symbolic data, such as ”variable y=cat” is speciﬁed by humans, in this case the symmetry or polynomial is meaningless, and they are not related to physics. However, the probability distribution of non-physical data y can be obtained by Bayes’ theorem using the physical characteristics of x. In the reference , a Physics-guided Neural Networks (PGNN) is proposed, which combines the scientiﬁc knowledge of physics-based models with the deep learning. The PGNN leverages the output of physics-based model simulations along with observational features to generate predictions using a neural network architecture. Reference shows that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). Reference using DBM and RBM to represent quantum many-body states illustrates why the depth of neural networks in the quantum world is so important, revealing the close relationship between deep neural networks and quantum many-body problems. Reference establishes a mapping of tensor network (TN) based on quantum mechanics and neural network in deep learning. Reference mentions that people have found more and more connections between basic physics and artiﬁcial intelligence, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machine and spin systems, deep neural networks and renormalization groups; the effectiveness of machine learning allows people to think about the deeper connection between physics and machine learning, and perhaps it can help us gain insights into intelligence and the nature of the universe. The research of the above reference mainly takes the neural network as a computational tool, or as a method to solve the quantum many-body problem. This dissertation studies the artiﬁcial deep neural network as a real physical system, considers that the neural network model is a real physical model. The goal of deep learning training is to obtain the neural network system model which accords with the physical laws by the interaction or response between the neural network system and the input physical information. Because the deep neural network is a physical system, its trained model and its evolution in training must meet the laws of physics. This dissertation analyzes the principles of physics embodied in deep learning from three different perspectives: microscopic, macroscopic, and world view, and describes deep learning with physics language, aiming to provide theoretical guidance and basis for further study and future development direction, and tries to establish the technology of deep learning based on the scientiﬁc theory of physics. A microscopic view of deep learning The biggest rule of the universe is that the world is made up of microscopic particles such as atoms, electrons and photons, which obey quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the science of studying the motion law of the microscopic particles in the material world, so the neural network model of deep learning as a physical system requires that the model must be governed by quantum mechanics. The following explains deep learning from the basic principles of quantum mechanics. The human brain neural network is composed of atoms, the number of billions of neurons is the same, and the computational methods of the human brain should be similar. The neural network, as an interactive quantum many-body system, determines the deep learning system to be described by the wave function. The coordinate operator, momentum operator (corresponding translation operator), angular momentum operator (corresponding rotation operator), energy operator, and spin operator in the neural network are the most basic and important physical quantity or mechanical quantity operator. 2. The physical meaning of neurons Information has both physical and symbolic meanings, so neurons also have two meanings: 1) physical, 2) symbolic mappings. Now discuss the meaning of its physics. In this dissertation, the ﬁrst hypothesis is that the neuron is the scattering source of the quasi-particle wave and the superposition of receiving the quasi-particle wave. First look at a classic physics experiment—Young’s double slit experiment. Figure 1: Young’s double slit experiment. As shown in Figure 1, the electrons are diffracted through the aperture a, and then diffracted and interfered by b and c. The bright diffraction fringes and patches at F indicate that there is a greater probability of electrons appearing there, and the dark part is there is little or no chance of the appearance of electrons. This dissertation holds that neurons act as electron diffraction interference. When we look at a neuron as a physical unit, the neuron is a scattering potential well that causes scattering of quasiparticles (perhaps this scattering originates from the quantum effect in the microtubules of the neurons, perhaps the electron-phonon coherence coupling in the biological system, perhaps some other kind of elementary excitation). Therefore, the output after the input of the neuron calculation is like the scattering output of the electrons through the circular hole, and the law is determined by the quantum physics theorem. The physical meaning of neurons indicates that, as white light can be scattered as red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, violet, it is a natural classiﬁer, calculator. In the Young’s double slit experiment, whatever the input is light, or electrons, polarized electrons, neutrons, and any particle including atomic and subatomic levels will cause diffraction and interference effects. In the same way, the physical meaning of neurons indicates that neurons are inherently capable of discriminating characterizations and are inherently capable of excellent generalization. The structure of Young’s double slit experiment provides the foundation for a universal quantum neural network. The physical model of neurons assumed in this dissertation is: The input of neurons is a multichannel wave function, for example, the input image is a wave function of multiple pixel points, and the photon (quasi-particle) wave function is superimposed to become the new scattering source output. The state value of the neuron is the number of quasiparticles (probability) of excitation after superposition, if you visualize multiple or large numbers of neurons, you see images of the same nature as the interference diffraction experimentłstreaks and patches. Figure 2: Neuron physical model diagram. The fundamental of this model is that the neuron is a physical model, which reﬂects the probability of its state value, and the related theories and deep learning techniques discussed later in this dissertation can conﬁrm the correctness of its hypothesis. 2.",
    "Methodology": "Although deep learning has achieved great success in many applications, there are still many limitations: for example, it needs a lot of data, the vulnerability of the algorithm etc. Why is the neural network easily disturbed by the input of small disturbances? From the physical model of deep neural network in this paper, we can see that on the one hand this is a physical problem, behind which we have not found new physical phenomena or new physical modes; On the other hand, labeling does not match the actual physical characteristics, such as cross-entropy, the two distributions cannot be approximated, or they are approached in a group of training data, it does not mean that the test data can match nonexistent labels, especially the deception problem. Therefore, the key to the vulnerability of the model is the limitation of human understanding. According to the physical world view of solving problems, providing anti-classiﬁcation is a direction worthy of study. 4. Causality and Correlation At present, deep learning pays attention to relevance instead of causality, and uses joint probability distribution to replace traditional theorems and laws. The theoretical foundation of deep learning methods lies in the representation and transformation of statistical probability distributions. It is consistent with the physical model of the deep neural network in this paper. That is, the state of the microscopic particle is completely described by the wave function ψ . After the wave function is determined, all the characteristics of the system can be obtained, the average value of any mechanical quantity and its measurement possible value and the corresponding probability distribution are also completely determined. However, in practice, a mathematical model of causality derived from statistical data will be comprehensively used. For example, these models can be used to establish a causal relationship between smoking and cancer, or to analyze the risks of a construction project, and so on. Can these mathematical models be extended to the microscopic world dominated by quantum mechanics? Can it be incorporated into the deep learning quantum physics model? Since quantum mechanics itself has many strange features, for example, if two or more quantum systems are entangled with each other, it is difﬁcult to deduce whether the statistical correlation between them is causal. The concept of causal information actually exceeds statistical relevance. For example, we can compare these two sentences: ”The number of cars is related to the amount of air pollution” and ”The car causes air pollution.” The ﬁrst sentence is a statistical statement, and the latter sentence is a causal statement. Causality differs from relevance because it tells us how the system will change under intervention. In statistics, causal models can be used to extract causality from the empirical data of complex systems. However, there is only one component in a system of quantum physicsłthe wave function ψ , so mathematical models that use causality derived from statistical data cannot be applied, including Bayesian inference. John-Mark Allen of Oxford University in the United Kingdom proposed a generalized quantum causal model based on Reichenbach’s principle of common reason , successfully combining causal intervention and Bayesian inference into a model.",
    "Discussion": "There are various interpretations of convolutional neural networks, but according to the above quantum physics model, CNN can be perfectly interpreted. The interpretation is fundamental and deterministic, it will inspire the architectural design of deep convolutional networks. (1) When the inner product of the convolution is represented by the norm and the angle: ∥ ω ∥ ∥ x ∥ cos( θ ( ω,x ) ) , the trained inner product of the convolutional neural network can be decoupled to ﬁnd the relationship between norm and angle in the feature map . Figure 6: CNN learned features are naturally decoupled.Figure courtesy: If the convolution of spherical coordinates is used, the relationship between the norm and angle in the feature map is more obvious: Figure 7: 2D feature visualization on MNIST dataset with natural training.Figure courtesy: The ﬁgure shows that the angles represent semantic/label differences, and the feature norm represents within-class differences. This result can be explained in our model. It can be seen from (Equation 14) that the general action potential U (r) is only related to r , i.e. U (r) = U ( r ) . So the convolution kernel is related to the norm and has nothing to do with the angle, the CNN feature image is related to the angle. The above experiments verify the correctness of the physical model of the convolutional neural network. (2) The number of convolution kernels is related to the color of the image. The input requirement in the scattering equation(Equation 8) is a monochromatic wave, that is, the convolution kernel(Equation 16) is related to the wavelength of the input wave, and different wavelength should have different convolution kernel K mn . Applied to the color image, convolution neural network should have different convolution kernel for different colors image. For example, they can be composed of three kinds of convolution kernels: red, green, and blue. Of course, they can also be composed of multiple kernels such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. (3) The number of convolution kernels is also related to the polarization direction of the incident wave. It can be seen from(Equation 16, 17) that even if the image is monochromatic, the convolution kernels of different z are different. So even if the input is a black-andwhite image, multiple feature mapping layers (multiple convolution kernels) are needed, just as white light contains light of all colors, and random monochromatic light also contains polarized light of all polarization directions. If the input is an electron, the number of convolution cores is related to the spin direction. In a comparable size, the number of feature map layers is much larger than the convolutional window size. (4) The reason of partial receptive ﬁelds is not because the pixels are usually highly correlated in neighboring regions. The convolution kernel sharing of feature layer is not due to translation invariance, they are due to the limited scope of the action potential U ( r ′ ) of the neuron, that is, the coordinate x ′ , y ′ in the convolution kernel (Equation 16) is outside the range of action potential. Therefore, the summation of the x ′ , y ′ in (Equation 17) does not require full space, i.e.the CNN should not be fully connected but partial connection. For the same feature mapping layer, all the neuron potentials U ( r ′ ) are the same, so the convolution kernels of all the sliding window convolutions of the same feature mapping layer are the same or share one, which explains from the scientiﬁc theory that the fundamental reason for the success of CNN is the important characteristic of CNN: partial receptive ﬁelds + weight sharing. In the actual application of CNN, the convolution kernel size (that is, the convolution window size) is often 3x3, 5x5, 9x9 and so on, scattering is mainly concentrated in the incident direction, so the window size is too large to be meaningful. However, if the 1* size of the convolution kernel is used, the interference effect will also be poor. In addition, considering the symmetry of K , convolution kernel size is generally used odd. (5) The purpose of pooling operations is not only to reduce the size of the output eigenvectors. (Equation 15) is the intensity of a neuron, and the image formed by all the neurons of a convolutional feature layer is an interference diffraction pattern. Because the coherence of the wave is strong in some places and weak in some places and not even in some places, and those ”bright” neurons will be the scattering sources of the subsequent convolutions, so each convolutional layer must be pooling. That is, in the convolution window area, the ”bright” neurons must be selected according to the intensity values of the neurons in each convolution layer feature layer, which is also the physical reason why the biological neuron can either output or not output even if it has a signal input. Obviously, pooling is an important computing component. In the early years, many of the studies based on convolution architecture used average pooling, now they are replaced by Max Pooling. From our model we can see that in practical application, because the window size is not large, it is reasonable to select one of the most bright neurons, that is, to adopt the max pooling method. It is also seen from here that the pooling is of decisive importance to the initial convolution layer, but as the number of layers increases, the interferogram sharpens and bright points become less, so the effect of pooling is weakened, which is the same as the result of the reference . Pooling can also be explained by the renormalization group in Section3.4. (6) The convolution kernel of different layer is not same, because each of the ”brightest” neuron positions represents the coherence of the corresponding convolution window image, which is related to the symmetry of the image and the structure of neural network. After pooling, the spacing as a new scattering source is different, so subsequent convolution kernels will also be different. That is, except for the same feature mapping layer, convolution kernels of each feature map layer of the convolution layer are different. (7) Coherence is the most important condition for multilayer CNN. In our model, the purpose of convolution is to create the entanglement of each pixel in the image under the action of neurons, thus forming the interference diffraction fringes or patches according to the spatial translation structure. According to the quantum mechanics, this is a coherence phenomenon caused by the superposition principle of waves. The total intensity after interference superposition is not necessarily equal to the sum of the intensity of the sub-beams, may be more strong or may be equal to under the interference. The important condition of coherence is the coherent wave. There are two ways to produce coherent wave, the ﬁrst one is to ensure that the monochrome of the wave and the phase of each wave of the ﬁxed, so need multi-layer convolution; the second is the interference of oneself and oneself, so need multi-layer convolution, generally need at least or more. Figure 8: Interfering with oneself causes CNN to require multiple layers of convolutional layers. If we understand from the biological neural network, the wavelength of the natural color of the physicist’s world changes monotonously from red to purple, but the system of human perception of color is closed-loop, such as the combination of red light and purple light is understood as the monochromatic magenta color. However, does not physically exist with a single physical wavelength of light corresponding to the color, but the human perception system fusion understands as a single color. Therefore, the convolution neural network must be fused or transformed after the input scattering (decomposition) must be multilayered. (8) Convolution is not the extraction of human knowledge such as image edges or colors, the convolution is the physical law and does not require human prior knowledge. From (Equation 2) to know the image gradient is obtained after the translation operation, so for the ﬁrst feature layer of the image we can see that it reﬂects the edge of the image. But as the subsequent continuous pooling and convolution, feature layer image will become more and more difﬁcult to understand and abstract compared to the original layer. However, in our model, the convolution image is a diffraction stripe or patch image after destructive interference or constructive interference, which is the superposition of the same or coherent wave. That is, the images are decomposed and classiﬁed by the same coherent attribute. The wave of the same phase has a destructive interference and the opposite phase has a constructive interference, and the interference diffraction patterns will effectively deconstruct the entire information of the incident image. And this coherent property is the symmetry of the image, according to quantum mechanics, the physical quantity described by the symmetry is the wave vector. It can also be said that CNN is to measure the wave vector of the image, because it is the XY plane convolution of the image, i.e. the measurement of the momentum p x , p y in the x, y direction. According to quantum mechanics, the z directional angular momentum operator is deﬁned as: ˆ l z = x ˆ p y − y ˆ p x , so it also detects angular momentum or rotational symmetry around the z direction. That’s to say, a trained CNN measures the translational symmetry of the x, y direction of the image or the rotational symmetry of the z direction through the translational operation and interaction of the image, is classiﬁed as the interference diffraction fringes or patch image that we see. The feature map layer is effectively classiﬁed according to the symmetry, and then the whole connection layer is mapped, which can effectively recognize the image. In summary, the above research shows that LeCun’s most famous contribution, the convolutional neural network, is entirely based on prior knowledge and that the idea of not requiring human structured knowledge is completely correct. CNN is based on the scientiﬁc theory, so it is the best method in image recognition. CNN is a physical model, so it is very successful in the processing of physical data such as images, videos, sounds, condensed matter physics, etc., but the performance is worse than other models when processing the strong subjectivity of symbolic modeling. For example, no matter how much data is input, it is impossible to train a model that can read product descriptions and generate an appropriate code base . 2.2. Signiﬁcance of classiﬁcation layers in CNN The convolutional layer is followed by a classiﬁcation layer whose meaning maps the mechanical characteristics learned in the convolution layer to human symbols (marks). The signiﬁcance of the classiﬁcation layer is expressed in: • On the signiﬁcance of the classiﬁcation layer, the ﬁrst is mathematics. In order to effectively apply the ability of neural network that can approximate arbitrary functions mathematically, the classiﬁcation layer must be fully connected. • The classifying layer in neural network is also physical. In our model, the neuron is a probability wave. The output of the last layer’s activation function must be guaranteed to meet the normalized requirement, generally, the softmax function with a clear physical meaning is used. The activation function is shown in Section 2.5. • The classiﬁcation must have generalization and must obey the laws of statistical physics and must cooperate with entropy. The content of entropy is shown in Section 3.2. 2.2. Development prospects of CNN (1) According to the neuron scattering theory, strictly speaking, the convolutional neural network should be extended to the complex number ﬁeld so that it can use the wave function with phase information. Thus, the input image is the intensity, and it should be squared root when used as a wave function, which is equivalent to the fact part: ψ ( x, y ) = I ( x, y ) However, in the actual calculation of CNN, the calculation on the complex number ﬁeld may not be signiﬁcant. In Equation 10, when we compute S , we need to square ψ , and | ψ | is proportional to the intensity of the image. The calculation of S in the real ﬁeld will appear negative, but subsequent Relu rectiﬁcation guarantees that the output is positive. It still conforms to the model where the value of the neuron is the intensity value, the signiﬁcance of max pooling is to ﬁnd the brightest neurons. In short, if the convolution is calculated in the complex number ﬁeld, the square root is computed ﬁrst, and then the square is computed, which is equivalent to repeating computation. And if the convolution is calculated in the real ﬁeld, input do not square root, output also do not square, the Relu rectiﬁcation function guarantees that no negative number will appear. By reducing the repetition calculation and saving the calculation amount, the calculation error can be reduced. There is no big difference between the calculated effect on the real ﬁeld and the strict complex number ﬁeld. (2) Choosing the appropriate convolution kernel is crucial for obtaining the most signiﬁcant and important information contained in the input signal. This allows the model to make better inferences about the content of the signal. The goal of this transformation is to change the data in a way that is more easily separated by the classiﬁer. According to Equation 16, a better model is designed using the convolutional features, such as better coordinates: cylinder coordinates or spherical coordinates of CNN . (3) The training of CNN based on quantum scattering theory obtains a large amount of input information, but the ﬁnal classiﬁcation only occupies a small part of the information. These are correct and objective reﬂections of the input information, it is easy to drown in the training process. This is undoubtedly a waste of valuable prior probabilities that can be used to migrate large-scale network knowledge into small-scale networks. Therefore, making full use of this information or data migration learning in other ﬁelds is also a topic worthy of study. (4) Multilayer CNN can not only perceive the translational symmetry and rotational symmetry of input, but also transform and perceive the fusion of various combinations of colors. In addition, it should also can transform and perceive the polarization direction of light. That is, CNN can perceive very rich three-dimensional scenes and behavioral information from static two-dimensional images. The geometry school will laugh : how can an image calculate three-dimensional, which is mathematically impossible. It doesn’t make any sense mathematically, but it makes sense physically! Human beings can perceive three-dimensions from two-dimensional images, and deep convolution neural networks can extract 2.5-dimensional information from two-dimensional images. This is the quantum effect: White light can be decomposed into red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue and violet through neuronal interaction or coupling or entanglement, and random monochromatic light can be decomposed into various polarized light. According to the physical model above, a lot of new information can be found from the polarization information, such as stereo information, like the principle of stereoscopic ﬁlm. This is an important prediction of the deep convolution neural network in this dissertation. (5) The CNN discussed above is to classify the spatial symmetry of the image by spatially translating and interacting with neurons. After the above measurement, the state after the collapse is measured as the new environment of Hamiltonian to state a new round of evolution. If the incident wave changes, such as the time dependent dispersion of the packet, the visual retention, or the Hamiltonian contains time, then it will be a Schr ¨ odinger equation that contained time. At this time Equation is time-containing, the green function is divided into the delayed Green function and the advanced Green function, which can be computed to predict the short future by or to recall a brief past. For time translation operations, according to quantum mechanics, the conserved quantity of time translation invariance is energy. Through the convolution of time translation, it is also possible to classify the energy properties of the input information. And the scattering of neurons contains time, so it will be an important research direction and may explain the important functions of visual retention, visual prediction and memory. (6) The convolution neural network based on quantum scattering theory is expected to compute the internal properties of the biological neurons and to gain more understanding of the functions of the biological neurons and the human brain. (7) CNN is supervised training, according to the above theory, it can be used in unsupervised pre-training and training. (8) In our neural network model, all the neuron cells of CNN form an image of a grid cell and a location cell, which is very similar to the image of the biological grid cell and position cell. It will be an important research direction to combine CNN with LSTM to achieve navigation like the brain grid cells. 2.",
    "25. It is used in deep learning applications to measure the degree to which the model distribution": "approximates the unknown distribution. Therefore, entropy plays an important role in deep learning, it has become the objective function of the selection and adjustment of the parameters of the deep learning model: • How the neural network adjusts parameters, in which direction the parameters are adjusted, the basis is the entropy of the random variables. • How to determine the conditions for the physical balance and stability of the neural network, the basis is the entropy of the system. For example, the entropy of an isolated equilibrium system must be maximum. • Entropy allows us to precisely deﬁne ” correlation ” and extract features from massive data. 3.2. Application of entropy in cost function According to statistical physics, a macroscopic state with a steady state and balance is a state where the number of microscopic states is maximum (i.e. the entropy is maximum). This is the physical basis for the selection of the cost function. The deep learning neural network discussed above are divided into two parts. The former is the neural networks that conforms to the laws of physics, such as each convolution layers of CNN, not only the characteristics of the trained convolution layer have physical signiﬁcance, each of the conditions in the training also has physical signiﬁcance. Because it is calculated according to the physical equations, except that this microscopic state does not correspond to the ﬁnal trained macroscopic state, or the number of microscopic states that the ﬁnal trained macroscopic state has is very small (entropy is small). The latter part is the classiﬁcation of neural networks, such as a convolution layer that then maps human symbols (labels) to their physical characteristics. This is a distribution of two completely different concepts, so the cross-entropy of the model’s output (physical) and the training target (labeled) should be used as a cost function to approach the real physical model. The magic of the wonderful combination of classiﬁcation problems and cross-entropy is that even if the cross-entropy on the test set is over-ﬁtted, the classiﬁcation error will not be overﬁt . For the regression problem, it is the same kind of problem, so the mean square error is often used as the objective function or the cost function, which is equivalent to the general entropy maximum. KL divergence is closely related to cross entropy, but it does not include the entropy of the model, it reﬂects the difference between the two distributions. Unlike the use of cross entropy, the KL divergence is used when there is no more physical distribution. These analyses show the powerful power of statistical physics in understanding deep learning. 3. Understanding deep learning from the concept of master equations The evolution equation of the Markov process probability distribution is the master equation, which is one of the most important equations in statistical physics because it is almost universally applicable. The Markov process is a process in which most of the memory effects can be omitted during the evolution process. When the system evolution of a random variable occurs, the transfer process will occur between different values of the random variables, by transferring the probability of the system changes in a given state until the system reaches a ﬁnal equilibrium state. In deep learning, one of the simplest examples of the Markov process is the Markov chain. The Markov chain is deﬁned by a random state X t and a transition distribution T ( X t + | X t ) . The transition distribution T is a probability distribution showing the probability of a random transfer to X t + in the case of a given state X t . Running a Markov chain is the process of constantly updating the state X t based on the value X t + of the transition distribution T . Among them, the probability distribution of the system state at time t + is only related to the state at time t , and has nothing to do with the state before t . 3. Understanding deep learning from the concept of renormalization group David Schwab and Pankaj Mehta found that the Deep Belief Network (DBN) invented by Hinton resembled the renormalization in physics in a speciﬁc case, which means that the details of the physical system are obtained in a coarse-graining manner to calculate its overall state. When Schwab and Mehta applied DBN to a magnetic model at the critical point (when the system is fractal and selfsimilar at any scale), they found that the network automatically uses a reorganization-like process to discover the state of the model. This discovery is shocking, as the biophysicist Ilya Nemenman commented, it shows that extracting related features in the context of statistical physics and extracting related features in the context of deep learning are not just similar, but they are completely the same.” . The renormalization group is a mathematical tool for examining changes in the physical system at different length scales. The details of the physical system are physically obtained in a coarsegrained manner to calculate its overall state. The important feature of this method is that it is independent of the system type. Each key step in the renormalization group method is based on the main characteristics of the system, rather than putting the system into the framework we are familiar with, and then adjusting the parameters . The standard renormalization process in statistical physics is equivalent to the feature extraction process of supervised learning in depth learning. The information is transmitted layer by layer and eventually converges to the theoretical boundary (ﬁxed points). The purpose of the renormalization group method is to obtain new features, and to ensure that the Hamiltonian function forms are unchanged under the new scale of renormalization. Figure 9: The pooling operation in convolution neural network. For example, the pooling operation (pooling layer) in CNN is based on the main characteristics of the system and uses the max pooling method to integrate the feature points in the small neighborhood according to self-similarity to obtain new features. As shown in Figure 9, the pooling layer uses the max pooling (where the size of the ﬁltering core is 2* and the step size is 2) to fuse a feature with an input size of 4* and retains only the largest feature point in the area, then the characteristic size after the pooling operation is 2*2, and the pooling layer plays a role of dimensionality reduction. It has been proved that there is a one-to-one mapping relationship between RBM-based deep neural networks and variational renormalization groups. The paper illustrates the mapping relationship by analyzing the DNN and numerical two-dimensional Ising model of a one-dimensional Ising model, and it ﬁnds that these DNNs self-realize a coarse graining process, i.e. Kadanoff block renormalization. The results show that deep learning may adopt a generalized renormalization group class scheme to learn relevant features from the data. The paper proved that deep learning is closely related to the renormalization group, one of the most important and successful technologies in theoretical physics. A physical world view of deep learning 4. The interpretability of deep learning The interpretability of deep learning models can be divided into the following categories: (1) Feature attribution VS Internal logic: The former maps the behavior of the model back to the original set of input features (or artiﬁcially creates optional input features). In the complex decision-making process of the model, the larger the inﬂuence of the characteristics will be assigned to the larger weight, the structure of human knowledge plays a decisive role in this model; The latter argues that: In the process of obtaining the ﬁnal answer of the model, it is the abstract role of the physical meaning of the model itself and the internal working logic, rather than human structural knowledge. Obviously, the interpretation of deep learning in this dissertation belongs to the latter. This paper analyzes deep learning from the internal logic according to the principle of physics, while most of the papers use the former method to explain deep learning. (2) Simulation acquires knowledge VS Introspection acquires knowledge: Knowledge based on simulation means that we obtain an understanding of our own model by generating some form of simulation data, capture how the model represents these data points for understanding; Introspection acquires knowledge comes from the ﬁxed orientation of the model and use them to gain knowledge without having to simulate the former. Obviously, the interpretation of deep learning in this dissertation belongs to the latter, while most papers belong to the former, the focus of their interpretation is to visualize the characteristics of deep learning. However, this dissertation holds that the deep neural network data has high dimensional data characteristics, and human beings cannot understand the visual characteristics of high-dimensional data. According to quantum statistical physics, a system with s classical degrees of freedom, the dynamic state of the system is determined by the wave function: ψ σ σ , ··· ( q , q , · · · q s , t ) Where q is the classical coordinate and σ is the non-classical degree of freedom. People think that deep learning is incomprehensible. It is precisely because it uses the ψ to characterize the macroscopic nature, which cannot be understood through visualization, nor can it be understood through mathematics. Deep learning is the interpretation of observed data using the dynamic characteristics of microscopic layers that are not observed by humans or that are not intuitively understood. 4. Locality One of the deepest principles of physics is locality, that is, things directly affect their surroundings. Locality is a relative concept, usually referring to the scope and degree of inﬂuence of a physical quantity. Locality has two effects: (1) Short-range effect: The interaction is only a nearby function, ignoring the effect of the remote, that is, the effect of the remote is averaged or canceled. For example, it has been explained before that during the operation of the Markov chain, the system state at the current moment is only related to the state at the previous moment, has nothing to do with the state before the previous moment, that is, the short-range effect. (2) Local coupling: The local roles of each regions are coupled and then coupled as localization. Scale changes, renormalization, long procedures, strong correlation, and coarse-graining. For example, pooling in CNN has already been described in the previous section. By using max pooling, similar features of neighboring regions are merged (that is, processes that are locally coupled), thereby achieving the effect of dimensionality reduction. 4. Symmetry Symmetry and conservation law are the basic laws of nature. Symmetry can not only reduce the number of parameters, but also reduce the computational complexity. See the convolutional neural network under the symmetry (translation invariance) we introduced in Section 2.2. Whenever Hamiltonian obeys a certain symmetry, that is, invariable under some transformation, the number of independent parameters required to describe it decreases further. The most important mechanical quantities of atoms are momentum and angular momentum, so the corresponding translation and rotation transformations are the most important and basic operations. For example, many probability distributions are constant in the case of translation and rotation. If the system has translational symmetry, then the state after the translation operation differs from the original state by a maximum of one phase factor, that is, the difference between the input state and the output state mainly appears as a phase shift. The input wave function can be labeled by the wave vector, and the physical meaning of the wave vector is momentum, which reﬂects the spatial symmetry of the system. The state with translational symmetry is the eigenstate of the momentum operator, and the momentum represented by the wave vector is the corresponding eigenvalue. Therefore, the process of learning the eigenvalue and the eigenvalue is the process of obtaining the wave vector. 4. Conjugacy and Duality Conjugacy is the amount of pairing. For example, in physics: pressure and volume, temperature and entropy, intensity and extension are conjugate quantities, in mathematics: real and imaginary numbers, transposed conjugates of matrix, and so on. Duality is the correspondence between the different physical theories that lead to the same physical results, such as, there is a reaction force with acting force, there are holes with electrons. These are the important organizations of physics, and they are related to each other and to each other in physical relations. This worldview is also used in deep learning. Here are two examples: (1) Stochastic gradient descent algorithm using momentum Although random gradient descent is a very popular optimization method in the training process, the learning process is sometimes very slow, and even cannot found the best point. The basic physical idea to solve this problem is to introduce conjugates and use duality to solve this problem. The cost function has a gradient g , there is ﬂow (or velocity or momentum), so the introduction of the momentum variable v . The gradient of the cost function is seen as a force that pushes the cost function to accelerate downhill and the momentum increases; if there is only this kind of force, the optimization process can never stop, so we need to add another force or gradient (called the viscous resistance) to make the cost function converge to a minimum; but the minimum may not be the smallest, so wo need to increase a momentum, let him out of the local minimum, so as to achieve the overall optimal. Update the algorithm as follows: v ← αν − εg θ ← θ + ν As shown in Figure 10, the contour depicts a quadratic loss function (Hessian matrix with illconditioned conditions). The red path across the proﬁle represents the path followed by the momentum learning rule, which minimizes the function. We draw an arrow at each step of the path, indicating the step the gradient will take at that point. We can see that the quadratic objective function of a pathological condition looks like a long and narrow valley or a canyon with a steep edge. The momentum passes right through the gorge, while ordinary gradient steps waste time moving around the narrow axis of the canyon . Figure 10: Stochastic gradient descent algorithm using momentum. Figure courtesy: (2) Annealing and tempering Temperature and entropy are conjugate quantities, when the temperature equals 0, the entropy equals 0(minimum); the temperature inﬁnity is the most chaotic, the model becomes uniform distribution. Using the temperature in the Boltzmann distribution, tempering: The Markov chain temporarily samples from a high temperature distribution and returns to sampling at unit temperature. Annealing: The Markov chain temporarily samples from a low temperature distribution and returns to sampling at unit temperature to ﬁnd the best among the different peaks. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the existence of a critical temperature. Most of the models used for prediction in deep learning generally use the softmax activation function to assign probability distributions to tags. The reference mentions that, in the image classiﬁcation problem, we divide the pictures into cats, dogs, and tigers three kinds. In a training, the probability of the three types is [0.0010, 0.0001, 0.9989], and the one-hot code of [0, 0, 1] is obtained as the classiﬁcation result (hard-target). However, the intrinsic link between cats and tigers can easily be overwhelmed during training. This is undoubtedly a waste of valuable a priori probabilities that can be used to transfer large-scale network knowledge into small-scale networks. In order to make full use of the correlation between such class categories, we need to change the probability distribution in some way to make it more smooth. In the reference, Hinton further modiﬁed the softmax function: q i = exp( z i /T ) j exp( z j /T ) When the temperature T = in the equation, it degenerates into the traditional softmax function; when T is inﬁnite, the result approaches /C , that is, the probabilities on all classes approach to equal; when T > , we can obtain the soft target label. By increasing the temperature T, the mapping curve of the softmax layer will be smoother, so the probability mapping of the instances will be more concentrate and the goal will be ”soft”. Therefore, in order to make full use of the correlation between such class categories, the method of changing the probability distribution is to increase T . 4. Hierarchy One of the most striking features of the physical world is its hierarchy. Spatially, it is an object hierarchy: elementary particles form atoms, then form molecules, cells, organisms, planets, the solar system, galaxies, and so on. Complex structures are usually layered and created through a series of simple steps. The observables of world are inherently hierarchical and cannot be commutative. The main reason for the success of deep learning is the hierarchical nature of neural networks (deep neural networks). In order to extract uncomplicated features, a multi-layer neural network is required to stack simple networks and then effectively implement the generation process through layering and combination. Multilayer networks provide layer-by-layer abstract channels from low to high levels. 4.",
    "Conclusion": "At present, the research on the internal theory of deep learning is very scarce, and the successful application of deep learning and the limitations of its existing technology further illustrate the importance of studying its internal technical mechanism from a scientiﬁc perspective. Only knowing why to do it can transform existing methods or means from a deeper level. This is the scientiﬁc way of thinking. Based on the principles of physics, this paper interprets the deep learning techniques from three different perspectives: microscopic, macroscopic, and physical world perspectives. Inspired by the biological neural network, a new neuron physics model was proposed. Based on this, it explains the success of deep learning well, and fully reveals the internal mechanism of deep learning by scientiﬁc methods. A good theory can not only explain existing experiments, but also predict new phenomena and technologies. Therefore, this dissertation also proposes the direction of further research in deep learning. Some of the main conclusions of this paper are as follows: (1) The deep neural network is a physical system, and its architecture and algorithm should conform to the principles of physics. The technical foundation for deep learning is physics, especially quantum physics and quantum statistical physics. (2) In this dissertation, the physical meaning of neurons in deep neural network is proposed: its output value is the distribution of quasi-particles. (3) Two physical models of deep neural networks are proposed in this paper, one is pure ensemble deep neural network and the other is hybrid ensemble deep neural network. The former learning model corresponds to a quantum measurement of a microscopic state, such as CNN; the latter corresponds to a microscopically statistically averaged macroscopic state, such as RBM. (4) The physical model of neurons in CNN is a quantum superposition of a quasi-particle incident wave (Figure 1) and is excited by the output. This excitation may be the elastic scattering caused by the incident wave (exit only includes the incident wave), or inelastic scattering (exit also includes internal new excited states), or various possible actions such as chemical reactions (exit only includes new quasiparticles). It obeys quantum mechanics. According to the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, the excitation output of a neuron is related not only to the intensity of incident quasi-particles in other neurons, but also to their coherence, and to their polarization direction or spin. (5) The input of the deep learning network is treated as a wave function, and the image is also a wave. The state of the neuron is also expressed by a wave function. If the measured neuron is the number or probability of excited quasi-particles, the value of a layer of neurons in the neural network is a probability distribution. The deep learning operator should be performed on the complex number ﬁeld, but because the activation function is ReLU, the computational difference in the real number domain may not be large. (6) Under such a physical model, the convolutional neural network algorithm is exactly the same as the quantum calculation method for measuring the number of quasi-particles excited by neurons, so that it can perfectly explain the technology of each important components of a convolutional neural network algorithm (convolution, rectiﬁcation, activation, pooling, etc.) The purpose of convolution is to measure the number or probability of quasiparticles excited by each neuron. The convolution kernel is related to the Hamiltonian interaction potential of neurons. All neurons present an interference diffraction pattern stripes and patches. That is, the deep convolutional neural network can measure the input wave vector or momentum, and its computational model can decompose white light into monochromatic light and decompose random-direction vibration into single-direction polarization. Therefore, the physical model of this paper can explain deep learning technology and success. This physical model shows that the deep convolutional neural network has natural learning ability and cognitive ability, and the model learns the ability to characterize the input micromechanical quantities, so it is reusable and can be applied across ﬁelds. (7) The basis for parameter adjustment and optimization in the deep learning classiﬁcation training process is the entropy in statistical physics, which is the number of microscopic states corresponding to the corresponding macroscopic state. Different types of training models should choose different cost functions according to the meaning of entropy, for example, the convolutional neural network model should use cross entropy as the objective function (cost function). (8) A large number of operators, techniques, and methods in deep learning are related to the principles of physics such as energy, entropy, renormalization techniques, and translation operations; they are also related to physical world views such as symmetry, conjugacy, locality, hierarchy, etc. The research in this paper shows that there are physics glimmers everywhere in deep learning. Deep learning techniques can be based on scientiﬁc theories. From the principles of physics, this dissertation presents the calculation methods for convolution calculation, pooling, normalization, and RBM, as well as the selection of cost functions, explains why deep learning must be deep, what characteristics are learned in deep learning, why convolutional neural networks do not have to be trained layer by layer, and the limitations of deep learning, etc. The physical model proposed in this paper can not only explain the successful technology of existing deep learning, but also predict many researchable directions and topics, such as positional neurons (these are in the research stage, and still need to be experimentally veriﬁed). There is a striking homogeneity in the appearance and structure of the human cerebral cortex. In other words, the cerebral cortex uses the same calculations to accomplish all its functions. All the intelligence that humans exhibit (vision, auditory, physical movement...) are based on a uniﬁed set of algorithms. The deep learning technology is also based on a uniﬁed algorithm and is supported by physical theories. It will have a broad prospect for development."
