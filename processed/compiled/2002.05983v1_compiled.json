I NTRODUCTION The stencil computation pattern is widely used in HighPerformance Computing (HPC) for weather prediction, seismic and wave propagation simulation, fluid simulations, image processing and convolutional neural networks. This computation pattern involves traversing a multi-dimensional grid, cell by cell, and calculating a weighted sum based on the value of the cell and its neighbors up to a certain distance that is called the radius of the stencil. First-order stencils are regularly used in image processing and convolutional neural networks. However, many scientific applications require high-order stencils in their computation. Three out of the nine nominees for the ACM Gordon Bell award in the past two years accelerated applications that involved high-order stencil computation [1, 2, 3], with both of the winners being among them. Compared to first-order (Fig. 1), the difficulty for implementing high-order stencils is two-fold: these stencils are more compute-intensive due to more computation per cell update, and they require more on-chip memory since neighbors are further apart in space. In the past few years, leveraging High-Level Synthesis (HLS) on FPGAs has gained significant traction since it allows programmers with no knowledge of Hardware Description Languages (HDL) to be able to take advantage of the programmability and better power efficiency of FPGAs [4, 5]. This initiative was further accelerated by the adoption of the OpenCL programming language by both Altera (now part of Intel) and Xilinx . In our previous work , we studied the optimization of first-order star-shaped 2D and 3D stencils on FPGAs using Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL. By combining spatial and temporal blocking, unlike many previous works on FPGAs, we achieved higher performance than the limit imposed by the external memory bandwidth, without restricting input size. Furthermore, using multiple HLS-specific optimizations allowed us to overcome the issues arisen from the added design complexity due to multiple levels of blocking. In this paper, we build upon our previous work to accelerate high-order stencils on FPGAs. We modify our OpenCL kernel so that apart from performance knobs (block size, vector size, and degree of temporal parallelism), stencil radius is also parameterized. This allows us to synthesize high-order stencils on our FPGA platform just by changing one compilation parameter. Our contributions are as follows: • We optimize second to fourth-order 2D and 3D stencils using one OpenCL kernel for each, and, to the best of our knowledge, report the highest performance for high-order stencil computation on a single FPGA. • We show that our combined spatial and temporal blocking",
    "Methodology": "remains effective for high-order stencils, allowing us to quickly choose the best performance parameters in every case. Regardless of stencil order, for 2D and 3D star-shaped stencils, we achieved over and GFLOP/s of compute performance, respectively, on an Intel Arria GX device. This level of performance is enough to compete with other hardware for high-order 2D stencil computation. However, even though temporal blocking is also effective for high-order 3D stencil computation on FPGAs, it is not enough to compete with high-bandwidth devices like Xeon Phi or modern GPUs. We conclude that for high-order 3D stencil computation, having high-bandwidth memory coupled with an efficient memory",
    "1 We consider stencil radius and order to be equal": "scientific publications, stencil order is equal to double the radius and hence, what we call “first-order” is called “second-order.” Fig. 1. First-order and third-order star-shaped 3D stencils II. R ELATED WORK Stencil computation, due to its importance, has been widely studied on different platforms. One of the most prominent works was done by Intel in , where they describe the 3.5D blocking compared to what can be obtained with temporal blocking but limited external memory bandwidth. This issue will become even more pronounced for the next-generation Stratix GX Read PE nWrite PE nPE nCompute",
    "Stencil Accelerator": "Fig. 2. Design overview, taken from • Shift register size and addresses for access to different neighboring cells in the shift register were parameterized with respect to stencil radius. • Comparisons with block and dimension variables were modified to take stencil radius into account. The exit condition for the main loop, which is compared with the global index, was also updated. • Boundary conditions were modified so that all out-ofbound neighboring cells correctly fall back on the cell that is on the border. Since this could not be efficiently realized using unrolled loops and branches, we created a code generator that generates and inserts the boundary conditions into the base kernel. • Support for non-square block sizes was added to allow more room for parameter tuning for high-order stencils Since stencil radius had already been considered in our performance model in , no further changes were required in",
    "A. Benchmarks": "We modified the baseline 3D stencil implementation from , available at , to support high-order stencils. To achieve this, we changed the computation in the main loop to reflect the following equation: 𝑓 𝑐 𝑡+ = 𝑐 𝑐 𝑓 𝑐 𝑡 + ∑ (𝑐 𝑤 𝑓 𝑤,𝑖 𝑡 + 𝑐 𝑒 𝑓 𝑒,𝑖 𝑡 + 𝑐 𝑠 𝑓 𝑠,𝑖 𝑡 + 𝑐 𝑛 𝑓 𝑛,𝑖 𝑡 + 𝑟𝑎𝑑 𝑖= 𝑐 𝑏 𝑓 𝑏,𝑖 𝑡 + 𝑐 𝑎 𝑓 𝑎,𝑖 𝑡 ) () In (1), 𝑓 𝑥 𝑡 refers to value in position x at time t , 𝑐 𝑥 refers to the coefficient for the value in position x, rad is the stencil radius/order, 𝑥∈ {Center, West, East, South, North, Below, Above}, and the set { x,i } refers to the i th neighbor cell in the direction of x . In this particular implementation, the coefficient for all the neighbors in a given direction is fixed; however, since we disallow reordering of floating-point operations, the coefficient is not shared and hence, the number of floating-point operations per cell update is equal to × 𝑟𝑎𝑑+ , with × 𝑟𝑎𝑑+ floating-point multiplications (FMUL) and × 𝑟𝑎𝑑 floating-point addition operations (FADD). Optimizing this implementation is equal to optimizing the worst-case scenario where all the coefficients for all of the neighboring cells are different. The 2D version of this kernel uses the same equation, but without the Above and Below neighbors. Table I shows the computational characteristics of our benchmarks. The number of bytes per cell update is calculated with the assumption of full spatial reuse (no redundant memory accesses). It is evident from the table that the stencil FLOP to byte ratio increases with its radius, which makes high-order stencils less memory-bound than lower order ones. B. Hardware and Software Setup Our FPGA platform is a Nallatech 385A board with an Arria",
    "10 GX 1150 device and two banks of DDR4 memory operating": "at MHz ( MHz double data-rate). We used Quartus and Intel OpenCL SDK for OpenCL v16.1. for kernel compilations. We avoided newer versions of Quartus (v17. and v17.1) since they reliably resulted in lower performance (2030% lower) and higher area utilization (5-10% more Block RAMs) for the same kernel. For power measurement, we periodically ( ms interval) read the power sensor that is available on the board using the API provided by the board manufacturer, and average the values during kernel execution. For comparison purposes, we used a 12-core Intel Xeon E5v4 CPU, and a 64-core Intel Xeon Phi 7210F processor. The Xeon processor is accompanied by quad-channel DDR4 memory operating at MHz. The Xeon Phi processor was set to operate in flat mode; however, we used numactl to set the faster MCDRAM memory as the preferred memory, and made sure the stencil input fits in this memory. All hyperthreads were used on both processors. We implemented our stencils, both in 2D and 3D, using the state-of-the-art YASK framework .",
    "Cell Update": "FLOP Byte 1. 2. 3. 4. 1. 3. 4. 6. for single-precision floating-point computation. The FLOP to Byte column refers to the ratio of compute performance to external memory bandwidth of each device. Without temporal blocking, computation of a specific stencil will be memory-bound on a given device, if the FLOP to Byte ratio of the stencil is lower than that of the device. Comparing the FLOP to Byte ratios between Table I and Table II, we can conclude that for every stencil order, computation will be memory-bound on all of our hardware. Since the FPGA platform has the highest FLOP to Byte ratio, it is the most bandwidthstarved platform and hence, is expected to have the worst computational efficiency. However, due to effectiveness of temporal blocking on FPGAs, we expect to be able to break away from the memory-bound nature of stencil computation on this platform.",
    "C. Benchmark Settings": "For FPGA benchmarks, to minimize redundant computation in the last spatial block and fully show the potential of the device, we set the size of input dimensions to a value that is a multiple of the size of the respective compute block dimension. If we denote the size of the compute block in each dimension by 𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 {𝑥|𝑦} , we have (from ): 𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 {𝑥|𝑦} = 𝑏𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 {𝑥|𝑦} − × (𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 × 𝑟𝑎𝑑) () In (2), 𝑏𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 {𝑥|𝑦} is the size of the spatial block in each dimension, and 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 denotes the degree of temporal parallelism. For 2D stencils, the selected value was between and , and for 3D stencils, it was between and . Exact numbers are reported in Section VI.A. Furthermore, we set the number of iterations to 1000, which resulted in a minimum run time of seconds for 2D, and seconds for 3D stencils. The amount of variation that was observed during FPGA execution was less than ms. For benchmarks on the Xeon and Xeon Phi processors, we tried multiple different inputs sizes and selected values that gave the best performance. On the Xeon processor, these values were and , for 2D and 3D stencils, respectively, and for the Xeon Phi processor, they were and . All benchmarks used iterations, for a minimum run time of seconds on the Xeon, and seconds on the Xeon Phi processor. All of our kernels use single-precision floating-point values. For the FPGA platform, we only measure kernel execution time and ignore data transfer time between host and device. For Xeon and Xeon Phi, we use the timing and performance values reported by YASK, which only include the stencil computation and ignore initialization steps. Our power measurement on YASK starts and ends with the built-in profiler. All experiments are repeated five times, and all values are averaged. We calculate performance in terms of number of cells updated per seconds (GCell/s) as follows: 𝑟𝑢𝑛_𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡_𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑_𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑠 × 𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 () Computation performance (GFLOP/s) and throughput (GB/s) values are calculated by multiplying the GCell/s value by the FLOP and byte per cell update values of the stencil, respectively. Redundant computation and memory accesses are not taken into account for the reported performance values. V. P ERFORMANCE T UNING",
    "A. Fpga": "To tune performance on our FPGA platform, we first need to calculate the number of DSPs that are needed to implement each cell update. On the Arria FPGA, each DSP is capable of performing one Fused Multiply and Add (FMA) operation. For each cell update in 2D stencils, × 𝑟𝑎𝑑+ multiplications and × 𝑟𝑎𝑑 additions are required. For 3D stencils, × 𝑟𝑎𝑑+ multiplications and × 𝑟𝑎𝑑 additions are required. In all cases, each multiplication can be fused with the addition that follows it, except the last one. Hence, × 𝑟𝑎𝑑+ and × 𝑟𝑎𝑑+ DSPs are required to implement one cell update, for 2D and 3D stencils, respectively. It is worth noting that with shared coefficients, only the number of FMUL operations will be reduced and the number of FADD operations will stay the same. Because of this, DSP utilization will only be reduced by one per cell update, since still one DSP will be required whether the operation is FMA or FADD. Since the Arria GX FPGA has DSPs, we can calculate the total degree of parallelism as: 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = { 4×𝑟𝑎𝑑+ ⌋ 2𝐷 6×𝑟𝑎𝑑+ ⌋ 3𝐷 () Then we have: 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 × 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑣𝑒𝑐 ≤𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 () Here, 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 and 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑣𝑒𝑐 refer to degree of temporal parallelism (equal to numbers of replicated PEs) and vector size, respectively. We restrict 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑣𝑒𝑐 to values that are a multiple of two, since the size of ports to memory are limited to such values. We also restrict 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 to values that follow (6) to allow best alignment for accesses to external memory (from ): TABLE II.

On the other hand, the FPGA can achieve multiple times higher computation throughput than its memory bandwidth, due to the effectiveness of temporal blocking on this platform. For the fourth-order stencil, even with temporal blocking, the achieved computation throughput on the FPGA is lower than the utilized memory bandwidth on the Xeon Phi device and hence, the Xeon Phi achieves better performance.

This assumption is not reasonable since streaming bandwidth, whether it is from FPGA external memory or the link between host and the FPGA, will remain the limiting factor in performance of stencil computation for the foreseeable future, and that is why temporal blocking is used.
